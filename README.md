1. Clone and Install
# Clone the repo:

$ git clone https://github.com/hamzaSghaier/ExpoDemo.git

# Move to the appropriate directory:


$ cd ExpoDemo

# Install dependencies:


$ npm install

2.1 Open RNS with Expo
First, you need to install Expo CLI (if you don't have it yet). You can do it by running the following command in terminal:



$ npm install expo-cli --global



2.2 Run the React Native App
# Start the React Native packager


$ expo start



Instructions are shown in the terminal. You can select to open it in:

An emulator (either iOS or Android)
Your mobile device with the Expo app. It will reload if you save edits to your files and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.
The local server will start with Expo DevTools on the browser at: http://localhost:19000.

Note: Is your build slow? Update npm to 3.x: npm install -g npm.
